# Parallel Monkhood Journal

This repository is a framework for keeping a structured, text‑based journal while walking a contemplative or devotional path in the middle of a turbulent world.

Many people feel that the dominant social and economic systems push them into patterns that conflict with their conscience, their sense of humanity, or their spiritual values. At the same time, they may not yet live full‑time in a monastery or intentional community. This project is for those people.

The goal is to provide:

- A clear structure for taking notes on teachings, courses, or modules (talks, workshops, retreats, etc.).
- A gentle way to connect those teachings with real‑life experience, work, and relationships.
- A format that mentors, guides, or spiritual friends can read and respond to, without needing special software.
- A durable, tool‑agnostic archive using plain text and Markdown, so your journey is not locked into any proprietary app.

## Who this is for

- People exploring monkhood, devotional life, or a parallel way of living alongside mainstream society.
- Mentors or guides who want to give students a simple, repeatable structure for their study and reflections.
- Communities who want to experiment with a shared “technology substrate” that supports humane, non‑exploitative living.

There are no specific beliefs required to adapt this framework. The language here is intentionally broad so that different traditions or communities can map their own teachings onto the same structure.

## How it is organized

- `modules/` – Templates for module‑specific notes (for each talk, course, or session).
- `examples/` – Sample entries that show how to connect teachings with daily life.
- `guides/` – How to use this journal personally or with a mentor.
- `meta/` – Vision, design principles, and notes on building parallel, value‑driven ways of living.

## How to use this

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy `modules/template-module-notes.md` for each teaching or module you go through.
3. Fill in the sections after each session, focusing on:
   - What was taught.
   - How it touches your life right now.
   - What you want to experiment with or change.
   - Questions or confusions for your mentor or guide.
4. Optionally, invite a mentor to your own private repository so they can read and respond to your notes.

Over time, your journal becomes a living record of how you are building a parallel way of life—one that values humanity, conscience, and sincere practice over simple compliance with the material status quo.
