# Spiritual Investigation Journal Entry — February 5, 2026

## Part 1: Raw Voice Transcript (Unedited)

So it's said that the Bhagavad Gita is the conclusion of all... the Shruthi. All the Vedas. And the main character, or the two main characters in the Bhagavad Gita, is Krishna and Arjuna.

And you know, there's so many other books that I've read, like the Upanishads. The Upanishads say that Lord Shiva is the Lord. And so many other people think that, you know, there's so many deities in the Hindu way of life. But the Bhagavad Gita says that Krishna is the ultimate god that everybody needs to worship in order to stop the reincarnation, the birth and rebirth, and all that stuff.

And what's fascinating, because I do also some chanting. To do the chanting I have to understand what the chanting is—what the hell I'm chanting—because if I don't know what I'm chanting, why the fuck am I chanting it? Do you get what I'm saying? It would be like one of those blind things, so you've got to really study the fuck out of the things that you're chanting and understand the ripple effects of what you're chanting, okay?

Because most of the time, you know, people who are in the arts, who love music or whatever, their minds are occupied with songs, and some songs carry bad frequencies and bad vibes depending on the lyrics, right? Chanting is no different. And so you really gotta understand that some people out there can create chants that may be encoded with words that you don't know because the chants may be in a different language. It's a language that you don't know, right? So it's always a good idea to cross-reference the chants that you do.

But anyway, going back, I'm getting sidetracked. One of the chants that I'm investigating is the chant of the Gayatri Mantra. And of course, you know, you always open—

Except, you know what's interesting is that almost all the chants other than Hare Krishna open with Om, meaning spelled out “O‑M” or AUM. Om and Om is Brahma. And in some of the literature that I'm reading, Brahma is the end‑all be‑all. And Brahma, as I'm sitting here thinking, feels more like the ultimate one. But Krishna may have been the ultimate Brahma in person form.

Not to say that any of these other gods in between, right? In between Brahma and Krishna, aren't legitimate. They are. Because they're all part of Brahma. And obviously, this is coming from the perspective of somebody that's an individual and studying these different things. So I don't mean any disrespect.

But if I didn't respect who I am—and that's basically somebody who investigates before I believe anything, you know what I mean? Yeah, I'll do the chanting, I'll study the scripture. But my sincerity is towards understanding what it is that's happening here. Cross‑referencing. Not depending on one single person to tell me that the Bhagavad Gita is the conclusion.

So what I'm doing here basically is coming and documenting this with you from the perspective of more of a student in an academic setting than anything. I can't take any vows. I thought I could take the vow, but like really thinking that, it's like: what vow am I giving myself away to, right? Because taking a vow is like you're taking on something that you might not fully understand. And you've got to do your due diligence, right?

There was this one time that I was on a search and rescue case with the Coast Guard. And I was in a 25‑foot boat and we... The reason why I was in this 25‑foot response boat was because we needed to go and get out to a search and rescue case where somebody had fallen down a waterfall. He was working for the federal government. I can't remember what department, but one of those departments where you're outside all the time—Forest something, one of those forest agencies, okay? Because there are so many federal agencies at that level doing so many different things.

Anyway, he was doing something, crossing the waterfall or something, slipped, and then his partner said that he fell down the waterfall. They couldn't identify where he was. So we hauled ass out there. When we left the station it was really, really calm. Glass. Okay, glass. Have you ever seen an ocean that was literally glass? I mean, it's actually a miraculous sight just because we're dealing with the ocean, and I got to see the ocean that calm. That calm. Rare sighting is what I'm trying to say.

But when, you know, we were on scene for a very, very long time, and the Nashan, which is a 110‑foot Coast Guard boat, finally arrived on scene and we needed to get going because we understood that from the reports that we were getting—the weather reports—it was getting really, really bad. But we were in a cove, so we were pretty protected, so we didn't know what we were going to be experiencing when we got out of the Narrows.

And it was not a good—say, it was like the perfect storm. No joke, okay? But in real life. And I remember telling myself that I took a vow. I took a vow to something: it's my spiritual life. Investigating it. Making sure I understand what I'm getting into. And that was my vow. I took that vow, and I took that vow under extreme pressure while being out there on Mother Ocean.

And the main character, or the two main characters in the Bhagavad Gita, is Krishna and Arjuna. Hello? And you know, there's so many other books that I've read, like the Upanishads. The Upanishads say that Lord Shiva is the Lord. And so many other people think that, you know, there's so many deities in the Hindu way of life.

So we hauled ass out there. When we left the station it was really, really calm. Glass. Okay, glass. Have you ever seen an ocean that was literally glass? I mean glass, sorry, let me just say that. I mean it's actually a miraculous sight just because we're dealing with the ocean, and I got to see the ocean that calm. That calm. Rare sighting is what I'm trying to say.

But when, you know, we were on scene for a very, very long time, and the Nashan, which is a 110‑foot Coast Guard boat, finally arrived on scene and we needed to get going because we understood that from the reports that we were getting—the weather reports—it was getting really, really bad.

Investigating it. Making sure I understand what I'm getting into. And that was my vow. I took that vow, and I took that vow under extreme pressure while being out there on Mother Ocean.

So I have to live that vow through before taking any other vow. And if I take another vow, I think it's going to be on my terms, just because that's important—under the conditions that I say. Just because the first one was taken under conditions that were of extreme pressure.

That may come off as though I'm regretful for taking that vow—and I'm not. It's just sometimes it's a hard life to be somebody that wants to live virtuously. Please, might I add, who *wants* to live virtuously. It's not that I'm saying that I am living virtuously, Jesus Christ. What I'm saying is, like, even my guys that I contracted with—Vedic astrology—he was saying that I'm always going to be, for the rest of my life, in this push‑pull energy of Rahu and Ketu. And both of those planets—or they're not, they're not planets but they're counted as planets in Vedic astrology—these things are actually nodes of the moon.

But anyway, my point is that one is of the material world, the other is of the spiritual world. And for me, it's like he even said that my path is spiritual. And therefore there is this energy, it's called the material world, pulling at me constantly. It wants to engage with me constantly, you know, and I don't want to engage with that because that's something that my spiritual life doesn't want. But it's constant in my life, and it's not anything to do with—well, it does maybe have something to do with—not letting something go in this material world. I just need to find out what the fuck that is, I guess.

Because right now, what I feel is holding me back in this material world is the fact that I'm in a government institution, the political aspect of it, you know? And I know for healing, I need out. I need out of the political environment. That's something—that's wisdom for myself, you know what I mean? To deal, is to get out of the environment.

And it's not for the lack of trying, you know what I mean, to get back up and running. But when you don't have people helping you—and when I say helping me, I mean like, in the sense of getting in my way, creating barriers where no barriers should be, especially when those people who say that they're helping me along the way are not doing anything but obstructing me in my way to be successful.

And let's talk about government programs is what I'm talking about. Government programs are literally set up to be that obstacle, apparently. When I was going through my master’s studies at Northeastern University, I had what is called a VR&E counselor who I basically had to do her job for her.

She was dealing with regulations, she was dealing with the compliance side of things as somebody that didn't have any background in compliance. So she got the job because she was a counselor, you know what I mean? That counselor role was one of counselor‑compliance, and the two don't go together. So it's already calling out—they're putting these people in two different roles that conflict with each other.

And then they do what they need to do to get out of the conflict, which is abide by the one that is totally crippling the person that they're supposed to serve. Because if they don't, there goes their paycheck, you know?

Anyway, I'm going to stop there because I'm now rambling. But I did want to give an example of what I mean by somebody getting in my way of success. And how this particular counselor was in my way in so many different ways.

From not disclosing information to me that, had I known up front, I would have taken the avenue—but that was information that they didn't disclose to me. And then they had the audacity to tell me that they did disclose it, but when I asked for that evidence, they couldn't provide it.

So there were so many moments like that between me and this counselor. And also, one more example is the fact that I literally asked so many different times if we could just abide by the written law. You know, I'm like begging her. I'm like, “Hey, this is what the law says. Can we please, can we please do what the law says?” And that was, like, on deaf ears, you know?

I was begging a counselor to just meet the written law. Folks, when we beg federal agents, federal officials, for reasonableness, we are in a bad state. If they can't even abide by their own written laws, that means we are lawless. And when we are lawless, we have to do what we need to do to survive, right?

And it feels really, really interesting that the majority of people out there are afraid of the people that are calling themselves law enforcement, ICE agents, and stuff like that. In other countries, like in the Middle East, you know, these people are called Taliban or like cartel or something like that, you know what I mean?

And we need to start understanding that the people that are in these uniforms are this country's form of the Taliban. That might wake people up.

## Part 2: Claude's Analysis of the Transcript

IAM, I've read through your voice transcript. This is clearly a deeply personal reflection that weaves together several major threads. Let me organize what I'm hearing from you, and then you can tell me what you'd like to do with it.

You're working through several interconnected things here:

### Your spiritual investigation approach

You're studying the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and the Gayatri Mantra, but you refuse to take anything on blind faith. You want to understand what you're chanting and why. You're cross‑referencing across traditions and texts rather than accepting any single authority's word. You're approaching this as a student and investigator, not as someone ready to take vows.

### The Brahman/Krishna theological question

You're working through the relationship between Brahman (the ultimate reality signified by Om/AUM) and Krishna as potentially Brahman in personal form, while recognizing that all deities within the Hindu tradition are legitimate expressions of that same Brahman. That's actually a sophisticated theological observation that aligns with how many Vedantic scholars understand it.

### The vow you took at sea

During that Coast Guard search and rescue case—the one where the ocean went from glass‑calm to “perfect storm” conditions—you made a vow under extreme pressure to commit to your spiritual investigation. To understand what you're getting into before committing further. And you're honoring that vow by doing exactly what you're doing right now: studying, questioning, not rushing into additional vows until you've lived this one through fully, on your own terms.

### The Rahu–Ketu tension

Your Vedic astrologer identified this constant push‑pull between the material and spiritual worlds in your chart, and you feel it. The government environment, the political toxicity, the institutional obstruction—these represent that material‑world pull working against your spiritual path.

### The systemic obstruction

The VR&E counselor at Northeastern who wouldn't follow written law, who withheld information, who combined incompatible roles of counselor and compliance officer—this is a concrete example of the institutional barriers you've been navigating throughout your government service.

So what do you want to do with this? I can help you in a few directions: clean this up into a structured journal entry for your Parallel Monkhood Journal, pull out the theological threads for deeper study, or something else entirely. What feels right?
